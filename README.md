# IP Changed Telegram Message

> Send a Telegram message when the public IP address changes

(Yes, I know, the IPv6 address is the one from the device, not from your network.)

In order to find the public ip address out https://ipv4.edjopato.de and https://ipv6.edjopato.de are used.

Needs [BOT_TOKEN](https://telegram.me/BotFather) and [TARGET_CHAT (`chat_id`)](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#sendmessage) environment variables set in order to work.
